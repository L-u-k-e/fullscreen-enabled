An element providing a starting point for your own reusable Polymer elements.


## Dependencies

###This behavior requires that an instance of lodash be instantiated in the global scope prior to its instantiation. 

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install
